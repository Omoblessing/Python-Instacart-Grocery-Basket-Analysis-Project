# Python-Instacart-Grocery-Basket-Analysis-Project

# Introduction

Instacart stakeholders are keen on understanding the diversity of their customers and their purchasing behaviors. They believe a one-size-fits-all marketing approach is ineffective and are considering a targeted strategy. This analysis will help identify the right customer profiles to improve sales through targeted campaigns.

# Key Questions

Key Question 1: The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
Key Question 2:  They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
Key Question 3: What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty?
Key Question 4: Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
Key Question 5: Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
Key Question 6: Is there a connection between age and ordering habits, number of dependants? 
Key Question 7: What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?

# Stakeholders

● Vice President of Marketing: “They are always looking into improving their targeting for ad campaigns.”
● Senior Vice President of Sales: “They need to know what part of their offering has the lowest market share and why. Based on this input, they could improve this sector and boost sales.”
● Instacart Customer: “They want to receive ads, promotions, and recommendations that are relevant to the products they order regularly.”

# Project Tasks & Deliverables

Below is a breakdown of tasks and deliverables done to accomplish the project.

Step 1: Installing and launching Jupyter notebook
● Install Anaconda
● Launch Jupyter

Step 2: Installing the recommended libraries (Pandas, numpy, and os)
● Create project folder
● Install required Python libraries
● Create a notebook and import libraries
● Practice coding using basic Python data types

Step 3: Importing Pandas data frame
● Download data and import into notebook as a pandas dataframe
● Conduct basic descriptive exploratory tasks

Step 4: Data Wrangling 
● Dropping columns, renaming columns, and changing data types

Step 5: Data Consistency Checks
● Fix mixed-type variables
● Uncover and deal with missing values
● Uncover and remove duplicates

Step 6: Combining & Exporting Data
● Merge a set of given dataframes
● Analyze results from merge flag frequencies
● Export merged data as a pickle file

Step 7: Deriving New Variables
● Create new columns using conditional logic in the form of if-statements, user-defined functions, the loc() function, and for-loops

Step 8: Grouping & Aggregating Data
● Create flags, for instance, a loyalty flag, and place them in new columns
● Create summary columns of descriptive statistics using the groupby() function

Step 9: Data Visualization with Python
● Import and prepare a customer data set
● Merge customer data with other project data
● Create histograms, bar charts, line charts, and scatterplots for different variables and relationships between variables

Step 10: Coding Etiquette & Excel Reporting
● Create a report that describes the analysis methodology, results, and recommendations for Instacart stakeholders


# Data frames used

● orders

● orders_products_prior

● products

● customers

● departments

# Libraries used

The following libraries were used: 

● Pandas : for data analysis

● Numpy: for mathematical equations

● Seaborn: for data visulizations

● Matplotlib: for data visulizations

● Scipy: for data equations

# Folders created

The project files are divided into the following folders: 

Project Management: Instacart grocery basket analysis project brief.

Data: Separated into two subfolders Original Data and Prepared Data. These contains the original data frames and data frames after thay have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively. 

Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks used for writing codes for the analysis.

Analysis: The analysis folder contains the visulizations created in Python for developing and explaining insights.

Sent to Client: The final report presented in Excel and sent to the respective stakeholders.

# Resources

 Instacart is a real company that has made their data available online. However, the contents of the attached project brief have been fabricated by CareerFoundry for the purpose of this analysis.
